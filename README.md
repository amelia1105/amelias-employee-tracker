## Credits

Although no starter code was available for this project and the project has been designed from scratch, I used some files from previous projects to get started. The package.json file was originally from the Module 8 Challenge (Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp > RUT-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2024-U-LOLC-MWTH > Assignments > Module 8 Challenge, https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/6369/assignments/90394?module_item_id=1341044). I made a few additions to this file to be able to implement PostgreSQL databases. The tsconfig.json and connection.ts files are from the Module 10 Mini Project (Rutgers University Coding Bootcamp > RUT-VIRT-FSF-PT-10-2024-U-LOLC-MWTH > Pages > 10. Day 3, https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/6369/pages/10-day-3?module_item_id=1341155). The .gitignore file was created by GitHub, as I created the repo online and added the .gitignore file there. The db folder and files within it were developed by myself. The index.ts file was developed by myself with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.
